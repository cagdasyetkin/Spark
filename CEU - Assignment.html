Before you start, send the *link* to this notebook (the url you are seeing now in the navigation bar of your browser) in email to: *ceu-data@googlegroups.com*. As you shared your account with Ryan and Zoltan earlier, through this link we will be able to monitor your progress using Databricks's notebook reports. Do all the work in this notebook in order to pass this assignment. It's important that we can validate your progress and time spent working on the assignments.  \n\nWork with your group mate. You can use the *Admin Console* through the top-right \"human icon\" to invite your group mate so you can both work on the same notebook, if needed. *It turned out that you can only invite collaborators up to 2 people. If you need to invite your group mate, please remove Ryan from the list.
